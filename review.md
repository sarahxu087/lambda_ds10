Your code is very clear and easy to read. It is well commented. 
If I am being very picky, I would say in the areas that you are testing your functions,
since nothing is actually printed, you may want to comment what should be expected to print.
That is the only thing I can be picky about, your code is pretty much flawless. It passes
the PEP8 test with flying colors. 

It was also pushed to test.pypi.org just fine and imported into my notebook.
